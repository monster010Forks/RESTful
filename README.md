# Requirements
This module requires CodeIgniter 4 to be installed and configured and running on PHP >=7.4.0
   - [This page may help you get up and running if you're not already.](https://codeigniter4.github.io/userguide/installation/index.html)

# Features
The features included in this module are:  

 - **Bin/Config** _[View Src Tree](https://github.com/jason-napolitano/RESTful/tree/master/bin/Config)_
   - Default configuration files that you will copy to your projects `app/Config` directory for the modules
   configuration
 - **Controller** _[View Src File](https://github.com/jason-napolitano/RESTful/blob/master/src/Controller.php)_
   - A basic controller that extends the `ResourceController` and bakes in a little bit more
   functionality
   
 - **Filters** _[View Src Tree](https://github.com/jason-napolitano/RESTful/tree/master/src/Filters)_
   - The `AjaxFilter` acts on AJAX requests based upon the `$ajaxOnly` config 
   option
   - The `AuthFilter` handles the authentication for `Basic` and `JWT` authentication
   - The `CorsFilter` checks a few CORS configuration options and responds accordingly
  
 - **Helpers** _[View Src Tree](https://github.com/jason-napolitano/RESTful/tree/master/src/Helpers)_
   - A series of useful helper files are included as well. These include String Helpers, Array Helpers, Object Helpers, JWT Helpers, an 
   Auth Helper and more!
     - _The `\RESTful\REST`, `\RESTful\Auth` and `\RESTful\JWT` helpers are autoloaded when a controller class_ `extends \RESTful\Controller`  
       
  - **Language** _[View Src Tree](https://github.com/jason-napolitano/RESTful/tree/master/src/Language)_
    - Language files are included for easier module translation
  
 - **Libraries** _[View Src Tree](https://github.com/jason-napolitano/RESTful/tree/master/src/Libraries)_
   - JWT Library for encoding and decoding of JSON Web Tokens (JWT's)
     
 - **Services**: _[View Src Tree](https://github.com/jason-napolitano/RESTful/tree/master/src/Services)_
   - `RESTful\Services\Auth` contains authentication services which are called in the `AuthFilter` and can be called globally like so:
      - `$auth = \Config\Services::auth($type = 'none', $getShared = false); ` 
      - `$auth = service('auth', $type = 'none', $getShared = false); `
        - Types included are `'basic'`, `digest` or `'jwt'`
    
# Installation
_NOTE: Please make sure to [install and configure CodeIgniter 4](#requirements) before performing the installation_

 1. ## Require
 - Use composer to require the package:
 ```php
$ cd path/to/project/root
$ composer require jason-napolitano/restful
```
_You may also add this to your `composer.json` like so:_
```json
{
    "require": {
        "jason-napolitano/restful": "0.9"
    }
}
```
_Then run `$ composer update` in your projects `ROOTPATH`_

 2. ## Autoload
 - Add the following to the `$psr4` array in `app/Config/Autoload.php`:
```php
$psr4 = [
    // OTHER PSR-4 ENTRIES ...
    'RESTful' => ROOTPATH . 'vendor/jason-napolitano/restful/src',
]
```

 3. ## Configure
 - Move the contents of `bin/Config` to your projects `app/Config` and overwrite. You may also only merge the contents of `bin/Config/Filters.php` with your own if you've already got custom filters you don't want overwritten.
 
**OPTIONAL** 
 - Configure your applications database settings in your applications `.env` file. This is optional if you plan to use Digest Authentication (coming soon)
 - From your projects `ROOTPATH`, run the `php spark migrate:latest -all` command. This is optional in order to populate your database with the correct tables for authentication and sessions.

# Usage
 - Modify your newly moved `app/Config/RESTful.php` for the aforementioned features
   - _The documentation in the config file should be able to explain everything_
 - Modify your newly moved `app/Config/JWT.php` for the JWT library
   - _This file is needed for the JWT library configuration_
 - Modify your newly moved `app/Config/Filters.php` for the aforementioned filters
   - _You may also reference `bin/Config/Filters.php` and apply only what you'd like_
