# Requirements
This module only requires CodeIgniter 4 to be installed and configured
   - This page may help you get up and running if you're not already.

# Features
Included features are:  
 - **Controller**
   - A basic controller that extends the `ResourceController` and bakes in a little bit more
   functionality
   
 - **Filters**
   - The `AjaxFilter` acts on AJAX requests based upon the `$ajaxOnly` config 
   option
   - The `AuthFilter` handles the authentication for `Basic` and `JWT` authentication
   - The `CorsFilter` checks a few CORS configuration options and responds accordingly
  
 - **Helper**
   - A useful helper file is included as well. This file can help with tasks such as JWT decoding/encoding, trimming arrays, moving files and more!
     - _This helper is autoloaded when a controller class_ `extends \RESTful\Controller`  
       
  - **Language**
    - Language files are included for easier module translation
  
 - **Libraries**
   - JWT Library for encoding and decoding of JSON Web Tokens (JWT's)
     
 - **Services**:
   - `RESTful\Services\Auth` are authentication services which are called in the `AuthFilter` and can be called globally like so:
      - `$auth = \Config\Services::auth($type = 'none', $getShared = false); ` 
      - `$auth = service('auth', $type = 'none', $getShared = false); `
        - Types included are `'basic'`, `'jwt'`, `'none'`/`null`
